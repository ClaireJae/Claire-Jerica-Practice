# Claire-Jerica-Practice
A creative website where we both experiment with different languages &amp; frameworks. 

# What is the website going to be doing?
- A combined but split website where we each can create our own pages regarding the same topics (Such as JS, C#, Python, etc.)
- Will help us both grow as programmers and understand things better by working alongside a friend.
